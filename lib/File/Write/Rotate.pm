=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use File::Write::Rotate;

 my $fwr = File::Write::Rotate->new(
     dir          => '/var/log',    # required
     prefix       => 'myapp',       # required
     #suffix      => '.log',        # default is ''
     size         => 25*1024*1024,  # default is 10MB, unless period is set
     histories    => 12,            # default is 10
     #buffer_size => 100,           # default is none
 );

 # write, will write to /var/log/myapp.log, automatically rotate old log files
 # to myapp.log.1 when myapp.log reaches 25MB. will keep old log files up to
 # myapp.log.12.
 $fwr->write("This is a line\n");
 $fwr->write("This is", " another line\n");

To compressing old log files:

 $fwr->compress;

This is usually done in a separate process, because it potentially takes a long
time if the files to compress are large; we are rotating automatically in
write() so doing automatic compression too would annoyingly block writer for a
potentially long time.


=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module can be used to write to file, usually for logging, that can rotate
itself. File will be opened in append mode. By default, locking will be done to
avoid conflict when there are multiple writers. Rotation can be done by size
(after a certain size is reached), by time (daily/monthly/yearly), or both.

I first wrote this module for logging script STDERR output to files (see
L<Tie::Handle::FileWriteRotate>).

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 buffer_size => int

Get or set buffer size. If set to a value larger than 0, then when a write()
failed, instead of dying, the message will be stored in an internal buffer first
(a regular Perl array). When the number of items in the buffer exceeds this
size, then write() will die upon failure. Otherwise, every write() will try to
flush the buffer.

Can be used for example when a program runs as superuser/root then temporarily
drops privilege to a normal user. During this period, logging can fail because
the program cannot lock the lock file or write to the logging directory. Before
dropping privilege, the program can set buffer_size to some larger-than-zero
value to hold the messages emitted during dropping privilege. The next write()
as the superuser/root will succeed and flush the buffer to disk (provided there
is no other error condition, of course).

=head2 path => str (ro)

Current file's path.

=head2 handle => (ro)

Current file handle. You should not use this directly, but use write() instead.
This attribute is provided for special circumstances (e.g. in hooks, see example
in the hook section).

=head2 hook_before_write => code

Will be called by write() before actually writing to filehandle (but after
locking is done). Code will be passed ($self, \@msgs, $fh) where @msgs is an
array of strings to be written (the contents of buffer, if any, plus arguments
passed to write()) and $fh is the filehandle.

=head2 hook_before_rotate => code

Will be called by the rotating routine before actually doing rotating. Code will
be passed ($self).

This can be used to write a footer to the end of each file, e.g.:

 # hook_before_rotate
 my ($self) = @_;
 my $fh = $self->handle;
 print $fh "Some footer\n";

Since this hook is indirectly called by write(), locking is already done.

=head2 hook_after_rotate => code

Will be called by the rotating routine after the rotating process. Code will be
passed ($self, \@renamed, \@deleted) where @renamed is array of new filenames
that have been renamed, @deleted is array of new filenames that have been
deleted.

=head2 hook_after_create => code

Will be called by after a new file is created. Code will be passed ($self).

This hook can be used to write a header to each file, e.g.:

 # hook_after_create
 my ($self) = @_;
 my $fh $self->handle;
 print $fh "header\n";

Since this is called indirectly by write(), locking is also already done.


=head1 METHODS

=head2 $obj = File::Write::Rotate->new(%args)

Create new object. Known arguments:

=over

=item * dir => STR (required)

Directory to put the files in.

=item * prefix => STR (required)

Name of files. The files will be named like the following:

 <prefix><period><suffix><rotate_suffix>

C<< <period> >> will only be given if the C<period> argument is set. If
C<period> is set to C<yearly>, C<< <period> >> will be C<YYYY> (4-digit year).
If C<period> is C<monthly>, C<< <period> >> will be C<YYYY-MM> (4-digit year and
2-digit month). If C<period> is C<daily>, C<< <period> >> will be C<YYYY-MM-DD>
(4-digit year, 2-digit month, and 2-digit day).

C<< <rotate_suffix> >> is either empty string for current file; or C<.1>, C<.2>
and so on for rotated files. C<.1> is the most recent rotated file, C<.2> is the
next most recent, and so on.

An example, with C<prefix> set to C<myapp>:

 myapp         # current file
 myapp.1       # most recently rotated
 myapp.2       # the next most recently rotated

With C<prefix> set to C<myapp>, C<period> set to C<monthly>, C<suffix> set to
C<.log>:

 myapp.2012-12.log     # file name for december 2012
 myapp.2013-01.log     # file name for january 2013

Like previous, but additionally with C<size> also set (which will also rotate
each period file if it exceeds specified size):

 myapp.2012-12.log     # file(s) for december 2012
 myapp.2012-12.log.1

 myapp.2013-01.log     # file(s) for january 2013

All times will use local time, so you probably want to set C<TZ> environment
variable or equivalent methods to set time zone.

=item * suffix => STR (default: '')

Suffix to give to file names, usually file extension like C<.log>. See C<prefix>
for more details.

If you use a yearly period, setting suffix is advised to avoid ambiguity with
rotate suffix (for example, is C<myapp.2012> the current file for year 2012 or
file with C<2012> rotate suffix?)

=item * size => INT (default: 10*1024*1024)

Maximum file size, in bytes, before rotation is triggered. The default is 10MB
(10*1024*1024) I<if> C<period> is not set. If C<period> is set, no default for
C<size> is provided, which means files will not be rotated for size (only for
period).

=item * period => STR

Can be set to either C<daily>, C<monthly>, or C<yearly>. If set, will
automatically rotate after period change. See C<prefix> for more details.

=item * histories => INT (default: 10)

Number of rotated files to keep. After the number of files exceeds this, the
oldest one will be deleted. 0 means not to keep any history, 1 means to only
keep C<.1> file, and so on.

=item * buffer_size => INT (default: 0)

Set initial value of buffer. See the C<buffer_size> attribute for more
information.

=item * lock_mode => STR (default: 'write')

Can be set to either C<none>, C<write>, or C<exclusive>. C<none> disables
locking and increases write performance, but should only be used when there is
only one writer. C<write> acquires and holds the lock for each write.
C<exclusive> acquires the lock at object creation and holds it until the the
object is destroyed.

Lock file is named C<< <prefix> >>C<.lck>. Will wait for up to 1 minute to
acquire lock, will die if failed to acquire lock.

=back

=head2 lock_file_path => STR

Returns a string representing the complete pathname to the lock file, based
on C<dir> and C<prefix> attributes.

=head2 $fwr->write(@args)

Write to file. Will automatically rotate file if period changes or file size
exceeds specified limit. When rotating, will only keep a specified number of
histories and delete the older ones.

Does not append newline so you'll have to do it yourself.

=head2 $fwr->compress

Compress old rotated files and remove the uncompressed originals. Currently uses
L<IO::Compress::Gzip> to do the compression. Extension given to compressed file
is C<.gz>.

Will not lock writers, but will create C<< <prefix> >>C<-compress.pid> PID file
to prevent multiple compression processes running and to signal the writers to
postpone rotation.

After compression is finished, will remove the PID file, so rotation can be done
again on the next C<write()> if necessary.

=head1 FAQ

=head2 Why use autorotating file?

Mainly convenience and low maintenance. You no longer need a separate rotator
process like the Unix B<logrotate> utility (which when accidentally disabled or
misconfigured will cause your logs to stop being rotated and grow indefinitely).

=head2 What is the downside of using FWR (and LDFR)?

Mainly (significant) performance overhead. At (almost) every C<write()>, FWR
needs to check file sizes and dates for rotation. Under default configuration
(where C<lock_mode> is C<write>), it also performs locking on each C<write()> to
make it safe to use with multiple processes. Below is a casual benchmark to give
a sense of the overhead, tested on my Core i5-2400 3.1GHz desktop:

Writing lines in the size of ~ 200 bytes, raw writing to disk (SSD) has the
speed of around 3.4mil/s, while using FWR it goes down to around ~13k/s. Using
C<lock_mode> C<none> or C<exclusive>, the speed is ~52k/s.

However, this is not something you'll notice or need to worry about unless
you're writing near that speed.


=head1 SEE ALSO

L<Log::Dispatch::FileRotate>, which inspires this module. Differences between
File::Write::Rotate (FWR) and Log::Dispatch::FileRotate (LDFR) are as follows:

=over

=item * FWR is not part of the L<Log::Dispatch> family.

This makes FWR more general to use.

For using together with Log::Dispatch/Log4perl, I have also written
L<Log::Dispatch::FileWriteRotate> which is a direct (although not a perfect
drop-in) replacement for Log::Dispatch::FileRotate.

=item * Secondly, FWR does not use L<Date::Manip>.

Date::Manip is relatively large (loading Date::Manip 6.37 equals to loading 34
files and ~ 22k lines; while FWR itself is only < 1k lines!)

As a consequence of this, FWR does not support DatePattern; instead, FWR
replaces it with a simple daily/monthly/yearly period.

=item * And lastly, FWR supports compressing and rotating compressed old files.

Using separate processes like the Unix B<logrotate> utility means having to deal
with yet another race condition. FWR takes care of that for you (see the
compress() method). You also have the option to do file compression in the same
script/process if you want, which is convenient.

=back

There is no significant overhead difference between FWR and LDFR (FWR is
slightly faster than LDFR on my testing).

L<Tie::Handle::FileWriteRotate> and Log::Dispatch::FileWriteRotate, which use
this module.
