Revision history for File-Write-Rotate

0.19    2014-08-20 (SHARYANTO)

          compressed [problem reported by Alceu Rodrigues de Freitas Junior].

        [ENHANCEMENTS]

        - Replace the use of 'gzip' binary with IO::Compress::Gzip, to allow

          de Freitas Junior].

0.09    2012-12-28 (SHARYANTO)

0.08    2012-12-28 (SHARYANTO)

          subsequent.


0.07    2012-12-27 (SHARYANTO)

        - Avoid using Log::Any, because we are used as backend for
